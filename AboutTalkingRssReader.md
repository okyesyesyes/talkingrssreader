# Feature Details #

This app fetches articles from your Google Reader RSS subscriptions
and speaks them out loud using text-to-speech.

It colors the sentence currently being spoken. It scrolls the text as
speech progresses. Conversely, if the page is scrolled manually,
speech picks up at the first full sentence from the top of the
screen. Allows jumping to the next or previous sentence using the
trackball.

Read the [Help screen here](http://talkingrssreader.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/talkingrss/res/raw/help.html).

Basic Google Reader functionality is supported, such as choosing one
of your feeds, subscribing and unsubscribing and starring items.

Except for the settings screen, all menus and dialogs are fully spoken
out, so that the app can be used without looking at the screen, making
it convenient for drivers and joggers, and of course blind users.
